## Active Rules

### Seed Rules (Pre-loaded)
- [2026-02-26] [Config]: Never modify shared configuration files without checking all downstream consumers first.
- [2026-02-26] [Scope]: If a "quick fix" requires touching more than 3 files, it is not a quick fix. Re-plan.
- [2026-02-26] [Testing]: Always run the full test suite, not just tests for the changed module. Cross-module regressions are common.
- [2026-02-26] [Dependencies]: Never add a new dependency without explicit user approval. Check if a built-in or existing dependency already solves the problem.
- [2026-02-26] [Data]: Never delete or overwrite production data, migration files, or seed data without explicit user approval.
